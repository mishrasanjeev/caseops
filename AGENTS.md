# CaseOps agent instructions

## User-approved spreadsheet fallback

For standalone spreadsheet creation or editing in this repository, prefer the
configured `@oai/artifact-tool` runtime whenever it is available. If that
runtime or `load_workspace_dependencies` is unavailable, the user explicitly
approved `openpyxl` as the fallback on 17 July 2026. Continue to apply the
spreadsheet skill's formatting, formula, inspection, and visual-verification
requirements when using the fallback.

## Permanent regression learnings

- A green source-tree test is not a deployed fix. Build the current source,
  verify the exact image/revision serving production, and rerun the same dated
  Playwright spec against production before marking an item fixed. Never use a
  stale `next start` build as evidence.
- Responsive acceptance tests must assert the user-visible surface at a
  narrow viewport, including every action/link in a grouped control. Nested
  flex containers must be explicitly shrinkable (`min-w-0`), full-width on
  mobile, and wrapping; an element merely existing in the DOM is not enough.
- Matter lifecycle state is authoritative and fail-closed: only the dedicated
  lifecycle endpoint may dispose or reopen a Matter. Generic metadata PATCHes,
  imports, workers, and child updates must not reactivate terminal rows.
  Status, `is_active`, lifecycle version, audit events, and operational-child
  neutralization must change atomically under the parent lock with an
  optimistic-concurrency token.
- A lifecycle regression is not complete until it proves dispose, stale-write
  rejection, operational-view suppression, controlled Disposed -> Intake
  reopening, no child resurrection, and final-state persistence after reload.
- `main` is the canonical source and release branch. Before declaring a
  change complete, ensure the validated commit is fast-forwarded or merged
  onto `main`, push `main` when remote publication is in scope, and verify
  that local `main` and `origin/main` resolve to the released commit. Do not
  leave completed fixes only on an agent branch.
- Performance acceptance must bound total work, not merely raise timeouts:
  cap candidates and child rows, prevent N+1 loading, batch provider calls,
  give interactive provider calls a deadline, and test production-scale query
  counts. After an abandoned request, verify an unrelated endpoint remains
  responsive so server-side starvation is not missed.
- On a concurrency-one service, a page must not fan out duplicate supporting
  requests when the primary response already contains that data. Interactive
  paths may not scan corpus-scale tables, resolve/download models or tokenizers
  over the network, or initialize model sessions on demand; use catalog
  estimates/materialized counters, baked local assets, process caches, and
  startup warm-up, then assert the end-to-end production latency budget.
- Cloud Run warm capacity must be configured at service level, not pinned to
  each revision. Production deploys must clear obsolete revision tags and
  verify latest-only traffic; otherwise tagged revisions with old pinned secret
  versions can keep restarting and consume capacity after credential rotation.
- When manual and bulk workflows select the same legal hierarchy, they must
  resolve one server-owned active catalog, persist the catalog ID and derived
  lineage, and reject inactive, ambiguous, mismatched, or invented entries.
  A UI-only hierarchy fix is incomplete.
- A controlled `Disposed -> Intake` transition and a later explicit
  `Intake -> Active` transition are not silent reactivation. Reopen audits must
  distinguish those events and prove terminal immutability across generic
  PATCHes, imports, workers, children, operational views, audits, and reloads.
